# Comparing Low 1st Round Picks and High 2nd Round Picks in the NHL
### By. Minchan Han

### This is my first Data Science/Machine Learning Project!
### I have collected draft data from Hockey-Reference.com to evaluate the value of the 16th - 45th picks.

### 1. How valuable are Low 1st Round Picks and High 2nd Round Picks relative to each other?
### 2. How valuable are these picks relative to the rest of the draft?
### 3. Is there any truth to the theory that beyond the very top picks of the draft, every draft pick is worth the same? Do they provide the same chance of producing a valuable player?

#### We will analyze our data to try and answer our questions, and at the end, we will train a predictive model to try and predict which players (drafted 16th - 45th overall in the 2006-10 drafts) will reach *X* games played based on where they were drafted!

#### Cells 1 - 12 = Data Analysis
#### Cells 13 - 31 = Predictive Model

### Special thanks to Hockey Reference for providing the data. Links to the filtered data is included in the notebook
##### Low 1st Round = 16th - 30th Picks | High 2nd Round = 31st - 45th Picks
