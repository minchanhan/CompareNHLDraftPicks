# Comparing Low 1st Round Picks and High 2nd Round Picks in the NHL
### By. Minchan Han

### This is my first Data Science/Machine Learning Project!
### I have collected draft data from Hockey-Reference.com to evaluate the values of the 15th - 45th picks relative to each other and the rest of the draft.

### Are the Low 1st Round picks (15 - 30) as valuable as we think?
### Are the High 2nd Round picks (31 - 45) just as valuable as the Low 1st Round picks?

### And how valuable are these picks compared with each other? What is the value increase as we go from 30 to 15? As much as any other 15 draft pick range in the draft?

##### Special thanks for Hockey Reference for providing the data. Links to the filtered data is included in the notebook
